POST-JAM
- Shake camera pos not world offset
- Current level animated cursor
- Add level selection animation (compare previously visible)
- Make menus clickable
- Mobile controls?
- Better wall jump (make whole game a bit slower?)
	- Bottom left of level 6 annoying wall jump
- Stick to ceiling for a few frames to make it easier to jump over box
- Music
- Level 4 too hard
	- Remove inertia
	- Show can jump from bottom border
	- Remove spikes and use void instead
	- Make zone larger
- Level 6 uses wall jump before introducing it
- More levels to introduce border merge
- Entity/solid corner correction
- More levels
	- Make stairs by pushing borders
	- Push border with boxes inside
	- Hard mode (grab gem then go back, more spikes)

- Cover and screenshots
- Parallax offset level annotation

TO FIX
- Hard to fit box in holes
