POST-JAM
- Finish parallax art
- Better tile art?
- Better wall jump (make whole game a bit slower?)
	- Bottom left of level 6 annoying wall jump
- Stick to ceiling for a few frames to make it easier to jump over box
- NG save integration
- More levels to introduce border merge
- Entity/solid corner correction
- More levels
	- Make stairs by pushing borders
	- Push border with boxes inside
	- Walk on spike with wiggle room
- Test all menus clickable
- Cover and screenshots
- Add credits below level selection
- Update newgrounds and itch cover and promo images
- Make video walkthrough
- Only set selected menu option on mousemove when not using other input method
- Test level select
- Check parallax perf

TO FIX
- Hard to fit box in holes
- Level 24 ending weird/unclear behavior?
- Level unlock not showing selected if not completed (to reproduce partially complete a world)

IF TIME LEFT
- Multitouch inputs
- Only move camera up when on platform
- Settings menu
- Title screen
- Undo (rewind?)
- Gem distortion
- Move touch input to controller package
- Parallax cross shape (prevent repeating moon)
- Hard mode (grab gem then go back, more spikes)
